    "When you open a file using the \"open\" function, you acquire a file object that represents the open file. When you are done using the file, it's important to close it in order to release any resources associated with the file. If you forget to close the file, you risk running out of resources, which can cause your program to crash or behave unexpectedly.\n",

    "The \"with\" statement provides a convenient way to automatically close the file when you are done with it, regardless of how you exit the block of code associated with the \"with\" statement. For example, if you raise an exception within the block, the file will still be automatically closed, even if the exception is not caught. This eliminates the need to manually close the file and helps to prevent resource leaks.\n",
